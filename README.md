MAC Address Masker: Concealing Device Identities through MAC Address Modification

Description: The MAC Address Masker is an open-source project aimed at enhancing user privacy and security by providing a simple yet effective solution to hide the public identity of devices. By leveraging MAC address modification techniques, this tool allows users to change their device's MAC address, effectively masking its unique identifier on local networks.

With the MAC Address Masker, users can easily protect their privacy and prevent tracking attempts by network administrators, advertisers, or malicious actors. By altering the MAC address, which is often used for device identification, users can maintain a higher level of anonymity while connected to Wi-Fi networks or other Ethernet-based environments.

Key Features:

MAC address randomization: Generate and assign a new MAC address to your device, making it challenging to link network activity to your device's actual identity.
Customization options: Specify a specific MAC address or use randomization techniques to generate unique addresses for each network connection.
Vendor-specific address support: Modify the MAC address to emulate a different device vendor, further enhancing obfuscation capabilities.
User-friendly command-line interface (CLI): Intuitive and straightforward CLI for easy execution and integration into existing privacy workflows.
Platform compatibility: Works seamlessly on popular operating systems such as Linux, macOS, and Windows.
By leveraging the MAC Address Masker, users can take control of their online privacy, mitigate tracking risks, and protect their personal information from unauthorized access. Help safeguard your device's identity with this powerful tool and regain control over your online presence.

Note: Please remember to use this tool responsibly and adhere to legal and ethical guidelines when modifying MAC addresses.
